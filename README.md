# Dashboards-Development-Using-Tableau-And-PowerBI 

This repository consists of information regarding the dashboards I have developed using BI tools such as Power BI, Google Data Studio, and Tableau.  

## Tools used

 - [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)
 - [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)
 - [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/)


## Projects (Many more are in queue)
#### 1. Yes Bank Stock Analytics
This dashboard visualization was based on Yes Bank stock market data. In this dashboard, we have used the old and current data up to 2019 to analyze and predict the trend of Yes Bank stock analysis. 



#### 2. McdonaldSchaefer Campaign Dashboard
This dashboard visualization was based on a Capital campaign. In this dashboard, we have used the 3rd party API (Quickbase) to get the real-time data and the dashboard that we designed was the collection of the record of donors on how much fund they are raising and collecting throughout different campaigns.

#### 3. Life Insurance Claim Analysis
This dashboard visualization was based on Life Insurance data. In this dashboard, we have performed analysis on how much insurance is claimed throughout the year depending upon profile, gender, cause of death, age group, and other key metrics.
